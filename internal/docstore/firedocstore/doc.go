// Package firedocstore provides an implementation of the docstore API for Google
// Cloud Firestore.
//
//
// Docstore types not supported by the Go firestore client, cloud.google.com/go/firestore:
// - unsigned integers: encoded is int64s
// - complex64/128: encoded as an array of two float32/64s.
// - arrays: encoded as Firestore array values
//
// Firestore types not supported by Docstore:
// - Document reference (a pointer to another Firestore document)
// TODO(jba): figure out how to support this
//
//
// Queries
//
// Firestore allows only one field in a query to be compared with an inequality
// operator (one other than "="). This driver selects the first field in a Where
// clause with an inequality to pass to Firestore and handles the rest locally. For
// example, if the query specifies the three clauses A > 1, B > 2 and A < 3, then
// A > 1 and A < 3 will be sent to Firestore, and the results will be filtered by
// B > 2 in this driver.
//
// Firestore requires a composite index if a query contains both an equality and an
// inequality comparison. This driver returns an error if the necessary index does
// not exist. You must create the index manually. See
// https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/indexing for details.
//
// See https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/queries for more information on Firestore queries.
