// Package docstore provides a portable implementation of a document store.
// TODO(jba): link to an explanation of document stores (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database?)
// TODO(jba): expand package doc to batch other Go CDK APIs.
//
//
// Representing Times
//
// Docstore can store and retrieve values of type time.Time, with two caveats. First,
// the timezone may not be preserved. Second, Docstore guarantees only that time.Time
// values are represented to millisecond precision. Many providers will do better,
// but if you need to be sure that times are stored with nanosecond precision,
// convert the time.Time to another type before storing, and re-create when you
// retrieve it. For instance, you could call the time's UnixNano method to get an
// int64, and get the original time back (in the local timezone) with the time.Unix
// function.
//
//
// Revisions
//
// Docstore gives every document a revision when it is created. Docstore uses the
// field name "DocstoreRevision" (stored in the constant docstore.RevisionField) to
// hold the revision. Whenever a document is modified, its revision changes.
// Revisions can be used for optimistic locking: whenever a Put, Replace, Update or
// Delete action is given a document with a revision, then an error for which
// gcerrors.Code returns FailedPrecondition or NotFound is
// returned if the stored document's revision does not match the given document's.
// Thus a Get followed by one of those write actions will fail if the document was
// changed between the Get and the write.
//
// Since different providers use different types for revisions, the type of the
// revision field is unspecified. When defining a struct for storing docstore data,
// define the field to be of type interface{}. For example,
//    type User { Name string; DocstoreRevision interface{} }
// If a struct doesn't have a DocstoreRevision field, then the logic described above
// won't apply to documents read and written with that struct. All writes with the
// struct will succeed even if the document was changed since the last Get.
//
//
// Queries
//
// Docstore supports querying within a collection. Call the Query method on
// Collection to obtain a Query value, then build your query by calling Query methods
// like Where, Limit and so on. Finally, call the Get method on the query to execute it.
// The result is an iterator, whose use is described below.
//
//     iter := coll.Query().Where("size", ">", 10).Limit(5).Get(ctx)
//
// The Where methods defines a filter condition, much like a WHERE clause in SQL. Conditions
// are of the form "field op value", where field is any document field path (including dot-separated
// paths), op is one of "=", ">", "<", ">=" or "<=", and value can be a string or number.
//
// You can make multiple Where calls. In some cases, parts of a Where clause may be
// processed on the client rather than natively by the provider, which may have
// performance implications for large result sets. See the provider-specific package
// doc for details.
//
// The Limit method specifies the maximum number of results to return.
//
// Docstore provides no guarantees about the ordering of results. There is no way to
// ask for a particular ordering.
//
// Use the DocumentIterator returned from Query.Get by repeatedly calling its Next
// method until it returns io.EOF. Always call Stop when you are finished with an
// iterator.
//
//     iter := coll.Query().Where("size", ">", 10).Limit(5).Get(ctx)
//     defer iter.Stop()
//     for {
//         m := map[string]interface{}{}
//         err := iter.Next(ctx, m)
//         if err == io.EOF {
//             break
//         }
//         if err != nil {
//             return err
//         }
//         fmt.Println(m)
//    }
